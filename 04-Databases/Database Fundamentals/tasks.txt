TASK 1 - Do you see any imperfections in its infological and datalogical levels? If yes, name them.

  - Office has no relational data to the rest of the entities.
  - Site Page has no relational data to the rest of the entities.
  - Account doesn't have a Transaction History attribute so it's not possible to correlate account with Transaction(operational) and/or Transaction(archive).
  - Account doesn't have a Status attribute so it's not possible to correlate Account entity with Status entity.
  - Account Owner entity doesn't have an Account Id attribute in order to correlate with Account Owner with Account.

questions.

  1. Should the account have a transaction history?
