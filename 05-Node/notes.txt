4) BUILDING RESTFUL API'S USING EXPRESS
  41. INTRODUCTION
  42. RESTFUL SERVICES
  43. INTRODUCING EXPRESS
  44. BUILDING YOUR FIRST WEB SERVER
  45. NODEMON
  46. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
  47. ROUTE PARAMETERS
  48. HANDLING HTTP GET REQUESTS
    - res.send()
    - req.params
    - res.status
  49. HANDLING HTTP POST REQUESTS
    - read body of req => use properties to create new obj => add obj to array
    - req.body (we need to enable parsing of JSON body of request, it's not enabled by default in express)
  50. CALLING ENDPOINTS USING POSTMAN (I used insomnia)
    - sending json body with post request
  51. INPUT VALIDATION
    - always validate input from client
    - validation logic
    - RESTful convention is to return a response through the http status code 400 (bad request)
    - in real world situation use of npm package like "joi"
      - define Schema (shape of object)
      - return error in case of wrong input
  52. HANDLING HTTP PUT REQUESTS
    - Basic operations
      - Look up data => If not existing, return 404
      - Validate => If invalid, return 400
      - Update data
      - return updated data (res.send)
    - Refactor to avoid duplication
    - check request with insomnia
  53. HANDLING HTTP DELETE REQUESTS
    - Basic operations
      - Look up data => If not existing, return 404
      - Delete data
      - return same data
  54. TASK
      - create service for managing the list of genres
      - each movie has a genre, like action, horror, etc. 
      - should have an endpoint for getting the list of all genres
      - should also be able to create a new genre, as well as update,or delete an existing one.
  
  5) EXPRESS - ADVANCED TOPICS
    57. Middleware
      - is a function that takes a request object, and either returns a response to the client, or passes the control to another middleware function
        - route handler function
        - express.json method is a built in middleware function => reads request and if there is a json object in the body object of the request, it will parse the body object into a json object and then it will set request.body property.
        - this happens at runtime
        - request processing pipeline
        - request => json => route() => response
        - an express application is essentially just a bunch of middleware functions
    58. CREATING CUSTOM MIDDLEWARE
    59. BUILT-IN MIDDLEWARE
      - urlencoded()
      - static()
    60. THIRD PARTY MIDDLEWARE
      - helmet()
      - morgan()
    61. ENVIRONMENTS
      - process = global object in Node that gives us access to current process
      - NODE_ENV = standard environment variable => returns the environment for this current application
        - console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV)
        - app.get('env') => this is returning 'development' by default
    62. CONFIGURATION
      - storing config settings for the application and overriding those settings in each environment (e.g. development environment uses different database for mail server)
    63. DEBUGGING

Q1) Why use config package? Why not just define folder and json files?
