4) BUILDING RESTFUL API'S USING EXPRESS
  41. INTRODUCTION
  42. RESTFUL SERVICES
  43. INTRODUCING EXPRESS
  44. BUILDING YOUR FIRST WEB SERVER
  45. NODEMON
  46. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
  47. ROUTE PARAMETERS
  48. HANDLING HTTP GET REQUESTS
    - res.send()
    - req.params
    - res.status
  49. HANDLING HTTP POST REQUESTS
    - read body of req => use properties to create new obj => add obj to array
    - req.body (we need to enable parsing of JSON body of request, it's not enabled by default in express)
  50. CALLING ENDPOINTS USING POSTMAN (I used insomnia)
    - sending json body with post request
  51. INPUT VALIDATION
    - always validate input from client
    - validation logic
    - RESTful convention is to return a response through the http status code 400 (bad request)
    - in real world situation use of npm package like "joi"
      - define Schema (shape of object)
      - return error in case of wrong input
  52. HANDLING HTTP PUT REQUESTS
    - Basic operations
      - Look up data => If not existing, return 404
      - Validate => If invalid, return 400
      - Update data
      - return updated data (res.send)
    - Refactor to avoid duplication
    - check request with insomnia
  53. HANDLING HTTP DELETE REQUESTS
    - Basic operations
      - Look up data => If not existing, return 404
      - Delete data
      - return same data
  54. TASK
      - create service for managing the list of genres
      - each movie has a genre, like action, horror, etc. 
      - should have an endpoint for getting the list of all genres
      - should also be able to create a new genre, as well as update,or delete an existing one.
